  	As a Extra Assignments :
	  	1)	- Function Pointers
  			- Double Pointer (Array of Char Array(string))
  		2)  - Multiple Pointer
  		    - Dynamic Memory Allocation	

# 1) 1-D ARRAY 
	TITLE: Set Operations

# 2) 2-D ARRAY 
	TITLE: MATRIX OPERATIONS
		Problem Statement: Represent matrix using two dimensional arrays and perform 
		following operations with and without pointer.
				a) Addition
				b) Multiplication
				c) Transpose
				d) Saddle point

# 3) STRING OPERATIONS 
	TITLE: With and Without Pointers
		Perform following String operations with and without pointers to arrays 
		(without using the library functions):
				a) substring
				b) palindrome
				c) compare
				d) copy
				e) Reverse.
			
# 4) ARRAY OF STRUCTURE
	TITLE: Database Operations
		Create a Database using array of structures and perform following 
		operations on it:
				a) Create Database
				b) Display Database
				c) Add record
				d) Search a record
				e) Modify a record.
				f) Delete a record.
			
# 5) COMMAND LINE ARGUMENTS 
	TITLE: FILE operations
		i) Write C program to implement TYPE and COPY commands of DOS using 
		   command line arguments.
		
		ii) Implement sequential file and perform following operations on any 
		    database:
				i. Display
				ii. Add records
				iii. Search record
				iv. Modify record
				v. Delete record


# 6) SORTING AND SEARCHING
	TITLE: Student operations
		Accept student information (e.g. RollNo, Name, Percentage etc.).
				a) Display the data in ascending order of name (Bubble Sort)
				b) Display the data in descending order of name(Selection sort)
				c) Display data for RollNo specified by user (Binary search)
				d) Display the number of passes and comparisons for different 
				   test cases (Worst, Average, Best case).


# 7) QUICK SORT
	TITLE: Mobile Database Operations
		Accept Mobile user information (e.g. MobileNo, Name, BillAmount etc.).
				a) Display the data in descending order of Name (Quicksort, recursive)
				b) Display the data in ascending order of MobileNo 
				   (Quicksort nonrecursive)
				c) Display pivot position and its corresponding list in each pass.
				d) Display the number of passes and comparisons for different 
				   test cases (Worst, Average, Best case).

# 8) SPARSE MATRIX
	TITLE: Sparse Matrix Concept
		Implement Sparse matrix and perform following operations on it:
				a) Addition
				b) Simple Transpose
				c) Fast Transpose

# 9) SINGLY LINKED LIST	
	Create a singly linked list with options:
			a) Insert (at front, at end, in the middle),
			b) Delete (at front, at end, in the middle),
			c) Display,
			d) Display Reverse,
			e) Revert the SLL

# 10) CIRCULAR LINKED LIST
	TITLE: Polynomial Expressions)
		Implement polynomial using CLL and perform
				a) Addition of Polynomials
				b) Multiplication of polynomials
				c) Evaluation of polynomial.

# 11) DOUBLY LINKED LIST
