# 1) 1-D Array (Set Operations)
	
	Perform following set operations using arrays
		   a) Union
		   b) Intersection
		   c) Difference
		   d) Symmetric Difference

# 2) 2-D Array (MATRIX OPERATIONS)
	Problem Statement: Represent matrix using two dimensional arrays and perform following operations with and without pointer.
			a) Addition
			b) Multiplication
			c) Transpose
			d) Saddle point

# 3) String Operations (With and Without Pointers)
	Perform following String operations with and without pointers to arrays (without using the library functions):
			a) substring
			b) palindrome
			c) compare
			d) copy
			e) Reverse.
			
# 4) Array of Structure (DATABASE Operations)
	Create a Database using array of structures and perform following operations on it:
			a) Create Database
			b) Display Database
			c) Add record
			d) Search a record
			e) Modify a record.
			f) Delete a record.
			
# 5) - Command Line Arguments (FILE operations)
	i) Write C program to implement TYPE and COPY commands of DOS using command line arguments.
	
#    - FILE HANDLING
	ii) Implement sequential file and perform following operations on any database:
			i. Display
			ii. Add records
			iii. Search record
			iv. Modify record
			v. Delete record


# 6) Sorting & Searching (Student operations)
	Accept student information (e.g. RollNo, Name, Percentage etc.).
			a) Display the data in ascending order of name (Bubble Sort)
			b) Display the data in descending order of name(Selection sort)
			c) Display data for RollNo specified by user (Binary search)
			d) Display the number of passes and comparisons for different test cases (Worst, Average, Best case).


# 7) Quick Sort (Mobile Database Operations)
	Accept Mobile user information (e.g. MobileNo, Name, BillAmount etc.).
			a) Display the data in descending order of Name (Quicksort, recursive)
			b) Display the data in ascending order of MobileNo (Quicksort nonrecursive)
			c) Display pivot position and its corresponding list in each pass.
			d) Display the number of passes and comparisons for different test cases (Worst, Average, Best case).

# 8) Sparse Matrix (Concept)
	Implement Sparse matrix and perform following operations on it:
			a) Addition
			b) Simple Transpose
			c) Fast Transpose

# 9) Singly linked list (Concept)
	Create a singly linked list with options:
			a) Insert (at front, at end, in the middle),
			b) Delete (at front, at end, in the middle),
			c) Display,
			d) Display Reverse,
			e) Revert the SLL

# 10) circular linked lists (Polynomial Expressions)
	Implement polynomial using CLL and perform
			a) Addition of Polynomials
			b) Multiplication of polynomials
			c) Evaluation of polynomial.

# 11) Doubly linked list (Concept)
	Create a Doubly linked list with options:
			d) Insert
			e) Delete,
			f) Display forward
			g) Display backward .


# 12) Generalized linked list
	Implement Generalized Linked List to create and display the book index.
